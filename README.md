# word_count

This is my first code review. I would've made more commits along the way if I felt as though my logic was correct. 
I wanted to get my first spec up and running before making any commits.
Through trial and error, I got my spec to pass. The first page of my app is working in Sinatra as well.
However, the result of the user input isn't returning any numbers. I'll continue to work on it. 
Once it's complete, I'll deploy it to Heroku.
